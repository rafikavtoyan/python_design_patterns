A remote proxy can be defined in the following terms. It provides a local representation of
a real object that resides on a remote server or different address space. For example, you
want to build a monitoring system for your application that has multiple web servers, DB
servers, celery task servers, caching servers, among others. If we want to monitor the CPU
and disk utilization of these servers, we need to have an object that is available in the
context of where the monitoring application runs but can perform remote commands to get
the actual parameter values. In such cases, having a remote proxy object that is a local
representation of the remote object would help.
