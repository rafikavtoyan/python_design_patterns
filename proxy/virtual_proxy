It is a placeholder for objects that are
very heavy to instantiate. For example, you want to load a large image on your website.
Now this request will take a long time to load. Typically, developers will create a
placeholder icon on the web page suggesting that thereâ€™s an image. However, the image
will only be loaded when the user actually clicks on the icon thus saving the cost of
loading a heavy image in memory. Thus, in virtual proxies, the real object is created when
the client first requests or accesses the object.
