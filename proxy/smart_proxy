Smart proxies interpose additional actions when an object is accessed. For example,
consider that thereâ€™s a core component in the system that stores states in a centralized
location. Typically, such a component gets called by multiple different services to
complete their tasks and can result in issues with shared resources. Instead of services
directly invoking the core component, a smart proxy is built-in and checks whether the
real object is locked before it is accessed in order to ensure that no other object can change
it.
